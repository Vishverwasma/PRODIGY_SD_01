This task involves creating a temperature conversion program in Java that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. The program begins by prompting the user to input a temperature value and specify the unit of measurement, either Celsius (C), Fahrenheit (F), or Kelvin (K). Once the user provides this information, the program processes the input by determining which conversion method to apply based on the given unit. For example, if the user inputs a temperature in Celsius, the program converts it to both Fahrenheit and Kelvin, and then displays the results.

The program is designed to be user-friendly, running in a loop that allows users to perform multiple conversions consecutively. After each conversion, the user is asked whether they want to convert another temperature or exit the program. This feature makes the program interactive and flexible, catering to the user's needs without requiring them to restart the program for additional conversions.

Internally, the program uses separate methods to handle conversions from each unit. These methods not only perform the mathematical conversions but also store the results in ArrayList objects corresponding to each unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin). This allows the program to keep track of all conversions made during the session. At the end of the session, after the user decides to stop converting temperatures, the program provides a summary of all conversions. This summary is displayed in a tabular format, showing the original temperature in one unit and its equivalent in the other two units, ensuring that the user can review the entire history of conversions made during that session.

The program is structured to handle potential errors, such as invalid input units. If the user enters a unit that is not recognized (anything other than C, F, or K), the program responds with an error message and prompts the user to input a valid unit. This error-handling capability ensures that the program remains robust and user-friendly, guiding the user through the correct usage.

Overall, this task demonstrates key programming concepts such as user input handling, control flow with loops and switch statements, method creation for modular code, and the use of data structures like ArrayList for managing and storing data. The completion of this task showcases the ability to develop a functional and interactive Java application that effectively meets the requirements of a real-world problem.
